Rust bindings to the [MapLibre Native](https://maplibre.org/projects/native/) map rendering engine.

## Usage

We use `maplibre-native`s' "core library", a static, pre-compiled library.
We also allow you to compile this yourself.
Instructions for this are below.

### Backend Features

This crate supports multiple rendering backends:

- `vulkan` (default on Linux/Windows): `cargo build --features vulkan`
- `opengl` (cross-platform): `cargo build --features opengl`
- `metal` (default on macOS/iOS): `cargo build --features metal`

If no feature is specified, the crate will automatically select the platform-appropriate default backend.

We also support the following other features:

- `pool` A tile rendering pool for building tile servers. See [`SingeThreadedRenderingPool`]() for further details
- `log`logging via the [`log` library](https://lib.rs/log)

At its core, we work as follows:

```rust
use std::num::NonZeroU32;

use maplibre_native::{Image, ImageRendererBuilder};

let mut renderer = ImageRendererBuilder::new()
    .with_size(
        NonZeroU32::new(512).unwrap(),
        NonZeroU32::new(512).unwrap(),
    )
    .build_static_renderer();
renderer.load_style_from_url(&"https://demotiles.maplibre.org/style.json".parse().unwrap());
let image: Image = renderer.render_static(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0).unwrap();

// Access the underlying ImageBuffer for all operations
let img_buffer = image.as_image();
println!("Image dimensions: {}x{}", img_buffer.width(), img_buffer.height());
img_buffer.save("map.png").unwrap();
```

> ***TIP:*** Next to the static rendering map mode, we also have continous and a tile based one.
> Continous is desiged to be interactive, while the tile based one is primarily for tile servers

### Platform Support

The following platform and rendering-API combinations are supported and tested in CI:

| Platform    | Metal | Vulkan | OpenGL |
|-------------|-------|--------|--------|
| Linux x86   | ❌    | ✅     | ✅     |
| Linux ARM   | ❌    | ✅     | ✅     |
| Windows x86 | ❌    | 🟨     | 🟨     |
| Windows ARM | ❌    | 🟨     | 🟨     |
| macOS ARM   | 🟨    | 🟨[^1] | ❌     |
| macOS x86   | 🟨[^2] | ❌    | ❌     |

<sub>
✅ = IS supported and tested in CI
🟨 = SHOULD be supported, but currently is not
❌ = Not possible
</sub>

[^1]: Vulcan support on macos is provided via `MoltenVK`. There is a slight performance overhead for this with little upsides. Both Metal and Vulcan run through the same extensive test suite upstream. You can use Vulcan if you find a bug in the Metal implementation until we have fixed it upstream.
[^2]: macOS x86 support requires local core artifacts. Set `MLN_CORE_ARTIFACT_DIR`, or set both `MLN_CORE_LIBRARY_PATH` and `MLN_CORE_LIBRARY_HEADERS_PATH` (or `MLN_CORE_HEADERS_PATH` alias).

### Dependencies

This command will install the required dependencies on Linux or macOS for the `vulkan` backend.
You may also use it with `opengl` parameter on Linux.
It is OK to run this command multiple times for each backend.

```shell
just install-dependencies vulkan
```

### Getting the core library

Since we wrap the [Maplibre native library](https://maplibre.org/projects/native/), we need this and its headers to be included.

We can get the library and headers from three places:
- <details><summary>default: downloaded from the releases page</summary>

  The specific version of [MapLibre Native](https://maplibre.org/projects/native/) used is controlled by `package.metadata.mln.release` in `Cargo.toml`.
  This dependency is automatically updated via a GitHub workflow on the 1st of each month repository.
  A pull request is created if an update is available.

  </details>
- <details><summary>if the env var <code>MLN_CORE_ARTIFACT_DIR</code> is set: from a local artifact directory</summary>

  This mode expects:
  - a core library artifact matching the selected backend and target naming convention
  - one of:
    - `maplibre-native-headers.tar.gz`
    - `maplibre-native-core-headers.tar.gz`
    - `headers/` directory

  This mode is recommended for unsupported precompiled targets, such as macOS x86.

  </details>
- <details><summary>if the env vars <code>MLN_CORE_LIBRARY_PATH</code> and <code>MLN_CORE_LIBRARY_HEADERS_PATH</code> (or alias <code>MLN_CORE_HEADERS_PATH</code>) are set: from local disk via explicit file paths</summary>

  If you don't want to allow network access during buildscript execution, we allow you to download the release and tell us where you have downloaded the contents.
  You can also build from source by following the steps that maplibre-native does in CI to produce the artefacts.

  </details>

## Development

- This project is easier to develop with [just](https://github.com/casey/just#readme), a modern alternative to `make`.
  Install it with `cargo install just`.
- To get a list of available commands, run `just`.
- To run tests, use `just test`.
